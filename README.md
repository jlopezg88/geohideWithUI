# geohideWithUI
I have developed a UI to make it simpler to be able to modify that node and which field you want to hide without having to modify the code. It is a simple form that is in configuration -> authorship of the content and you simply have to fill out the form and you are ready.

Important: Rename geogideWithUI by geohide.

I hope you find it useful.
